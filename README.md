## Bugs
Sound bugs are known and due to non-thread treatment of mediaplayers. Not enough time to implement the best and workable solution. Feel free to correct and make a PR.

## Evolutions
A third game mode based on number of card movement could be implemented. 
Intermediate difficulty could be set and easy difficulty made easier.
